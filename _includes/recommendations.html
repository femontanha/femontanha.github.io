              I could say so much about all his skills regarding front-end, but I'd like to say that Fellipe is that guy you need to have on your team.
              Every good team relies not only on great professionals, but also in great people, because... no matter how awesome is your team technically speaking, you always have to deal with people.
              Fellipe is not only an excellent front-end developer, he's a great man.
              Worked, flawless, on one of the biggest e-commerce in the world.
